PART 1 — FIXED-LENGTH SUBNETTING
Given Network: 172.16.0.0/24 Required Subnets:
Subnet A: 40 hosts
Subnet B: 20 hosts
Subnet C: 10 hosts
Subnet D: 5 hosts

Fixed-length subnetting means all subnets must be of equal size.
Step 1 — Determine Subnet Size
We need the largest host requirement → 40 hosts.
Formula:
Hosts = 2^h – 2  ≥ 40
2^6 – 2 = 62  → OK
So we need 6 host bits, leaving:
Prefix = 32 – 6 = /26
Subnet mask = 255.255.255.192
Each subnet size = 2⁶ = 64 addresses per subnet
Step 2 — Create Subnets of /26

Step 3 — Packet Tracer Topology
Use:
1 Router
4 Switches
Multiple PCs in each subnet
To add new interfaces (Extra Ports)
 	Drag the Router to the Workspace
From Devices → Routers
Choose Cisco 2911
Drag onto the workspace.
Power OFF the Router
You cannot insert modules while powered on.
Click the router
Go to the Physical tab
Find the Power button (left side → switch)
Click it → It turns red (OFF)

Choose a Module to Add
Common modules for extra ports:

For subnetting labs, the HWIC-4ESW is the easiest and most used.

Insert the Module
In the router’s Physical tab, you’ll see empty HWIC slots.
Drag the module (e.g., HWIC-4ESW) from the left panel
Drop it into an empty slot.
You will see the module appear with new ports like:
		Fa0/0
	Fa0/1
		Fa0/2
		Fa0/3

Power ON the Router
Click the same power switch
It turns green (ON)
Go to CLI and Verify Ports
Open CLI → type:
		show ip interface brief
You should now see the new interfaces.
Connect:
Step 4 — Router Configuration
Example for Router:
enable
configure terminal

interface g0/0
 ip address 172.16.0.1 255.255.255.192
 no shutdown

interface g0/1
 ip address 172.16.0.65 255.255.255.192
 no shutdown

interface g0/2
 ip address 172.16.0.129 255.255.255.192
 no shutdown

interface g0/3
 ip address 172.16.0.193 255.255.255.192
 no shutdown
Since a single router is used, routing is automatic (no static routes needed).
Step 5 — PC Configuration Example
PC in Subnet A:
IP: 172.16.0.10
Mask: 255.255.255.192
Gateway: 172.16.0.1
Repeat for all PCs.
Step 6 — Verification
Ping across subnets:
PC-A → PC-B
PC-A → PC-C
PC-A → PC-D
