# Computer Networkings

This repository contains all my **Computer Networks Lab Assignments**, including:
- Cisco Packet Tracer configuration files (`.pkt`)
- Lab manuals and solutions
- Screenshots of outputs and observations
- Supporting notes or explanations where needed

The goal of this repository is to **organize and share** my networking lab work as part of my coursework in **Computer Science and Engineering**.  
It also serves as a helpful reference for anyone learning or revising core networking concepts and practical configurations.
